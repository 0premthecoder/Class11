## Units

**Units**: are the accepted reference, It is words and symbols for representing physical quantity

## Types of Units

**Fundamental Unit**: Unit for the base quantities are called fundamental or base units These are not derived from any Units

### There are 7 Fundamental Unit

| Base Quantity | SI Unit | |
| -------- | ------- | ---|
|           |Name | symbols|
|           Length| metre| `m`|
| Mass| kilogram| `kg`|
| Time | Second | `s`|
| Electric| Ampere| `A`|
|Temperature| Kelvin| `K`|
|Amount of Substance| mole|`mol`|
|Luminous Intensity| candela | `cd`|

**Derived Units**: The unit of all Other Quantities can be expressed as combination of the base units it is derived from fundamental unit

### System of units

- `MKS: metre, kilogram, second`
- `FPS: foot, pound, second`
- `CGS: centimetre , gram, second`

## Significant Figures

**Definition**: The Reliable Digits plus the first uncertain digit are known as significant figures Significant figures are used to round a number to the level of importance in the details that is most useful.

### Rules for Significant Figures

- All non-zero digits are significant.
- Zeroes between non-zero digits are significant.
- A trailing zero or final zero in the decimal portion only are significant.

```sh
 The calculator answer is 2,085.5688, but we need to round it to five significant figures. Because the first digit to be dropped (in the tenths place) is greater than 5, we round up to 2,085.6.
