## Matter

Matter: Anything which has mass and occupies space is called matter.

### States of Matter

- Solid : solids in an orderly fashion and there is not
much freedom of movement.

- Liquid: the particles are close to each other but they can
move around
- Gas:  the particles
are far apart as compared to those present in
solid or liquid states and their movement is
easy and fast.

Solid | Liquid | Gas
--|--|--
Solid have definite shape and volume| Liquid have definite volume but no shape| Gas neither have definite shape and nor volume

more pure substances which may be present 
in it in any ratio. 

    - Homogeneous mixtures: Compone
